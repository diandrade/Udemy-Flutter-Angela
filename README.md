# Projects Completed in Angela Yu's Course

These projects were developed as part of the iOS and Flutter development course by Angela Yu. The course covers various concepts including navigation, state management, user interface design, and integrating APIs. Below are some of the projects I worked on:

1. **BMI Calculator** - A simple app to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.
2. **Destini** - A decision-making app where users make choices that lead to different outcomes.
3. **Dicee** - A fun app that simulates rolling two dice and displays the result.
4. **I-Am-Poor** - An app that randomly displays messages when users need a reminder to stay positive.
5. **Magic-8-Ball** - An app that answers user questions with a random response, inspired by the classic Magic 8 Ball toy.
6. **Mi Card** - A digital business card app that displays information about the user.
7. **Navigation Flutter Demo** - A demo app showcasing navigation features in Flutter.
8. **Quizzler** - A quiz app that presents questions and checks user answers.
9. **Xylophone** - A musical app that simulates a xylophone with a range of notes.

These projects helped me enhance my skills in app development, including working with **Flutter** and **Dart** to create interactive and user-friendly mobile applications.
